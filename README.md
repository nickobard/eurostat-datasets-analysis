# Eurostat Datasets Analysis

This repository contains three data analysis projects that focus on statistical exploration and modeling of various datasets using R language.


Projects are done in a team of three students. My parts of work are highlighted with ⭐.

## [Project 1: Crime Data Analysis](sem-1)

- **Objective**: Analyze crime statistics across different regions within a European country.
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform basic statistical analyses and compute descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
  - Create visual representations using appropriate graphs to illustrate findings.
  - ⭐ Construct contingency tables to examine relationships between types of crimes and regions.
  - ⭐ Formulate and test statistical hypotheses based on the observed data.
  - Interpret the results of statistical tests both mathematically and in practical terms.

## [Project 2: Regression Analysis with Multiple Regressors](sem-2)

- **Objective**: Investigate the dependence of a specific variable on various regressors from datasets provided by the R library Sleuth2.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics and graphical visualizations.
  - Examine the relationship between the dependent variable and a numerical regressor using linear regression models; interpret regression coefficients and assess model quality.
  - Analyze the effect of a categorical regressor on the dependent variable using analysis of variance (ANOVA); interpret the results and evaluate model fit.
  - ⭐ Develop a regression model incorporating both numerical and categorical regressors, including interaction effects; estimate parameters and interpret their significance.
  - ⭐ Introduce additional regressors to enhance the model, perform variable selection, and determine the significance of each component.
  - ⭐ Verify model assumptions and perform diagnostics to ensure validity and reliability.

## [Project 3: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Analysis](sem-3)

- **Objective**: Examine factors influencing the GDP of European countries using statistical modeling.
- **Tasks**:
  - Present and summarize GDP data both numerically and graphically to understand its distribution.
  - Select relevant demographic, geographic, or economic indicators (both numerical and categorical) that may impact GDP.
  - Analyze the relationships between selected regressors and GDP, as well as interdependencies among regressors.
  - ⭐ Build linear regression models to assess the dependence of GDP on the chosen variables; interpret regression coefficients and evaluate model performance.
  - ⭐ Identify outliers and address issues of multicollinearity among regressors.
  - ⭐ Test model assumptions and apply appropriate methods to mitigate any violations.
  - ⭐ Refine the model by selecting significant variables to develop a final, optimized model that effectively explains variations in GDP.
